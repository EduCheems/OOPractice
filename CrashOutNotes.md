# CCPROG3: Object Oriented Programming

## SESSION 1: The Object-oriented Thinking Process

#### OOP means you apply variables as real-life objects with real-life relations, functions, and attributes via coding: 


**1.** Start with a concept:Object -> Attributes -> Functions/Behavior (Methods) 


**2.** Check the relationship with other objects: 


##### -What is the child/parent relationship with other objects/classes? -> **Inheritance**


##### -Wanna change something bout the object without affecting other attributes/behavior? -> **Encapsulation**
