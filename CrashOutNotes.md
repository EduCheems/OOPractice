# CCPROG3: Object Oriented Programming

## SESSION 1: The Object-oriented Thinking Process

#### OOP means you apply variables as real-life objects with real-life relations, functions, and attributes via coding: 


**1.** Start with a concept:Object -> Attributes -> Functions/Behavior (Methods) 


**2.** Check the relationship with other objects: 


- What is the child/parent relationship with other objects/classes? -> **Inheritance**


- Wanna change something bout the object without affecting other attributes/behavior? -> **Encapsulation**


- You intend to make your object flexible or like it can be anything? -> **Polymorphism (Runtime and Compile-Time)** 


- Hide other details and show only what's needed bout the object? -> **Abstraction**


**3.** Scope and Capabilities: What's the scope (fields) / capabilities and functions (methods) of the object? 


**4.** Anticipate what would happen if you change something: Where should you go when modfying something / what would break if you chance something? 


**5.** Don't repeat yourself: It's self explanatory bro hahaha 


### Example: Make relationships using domain, School Systems:


#### **Class:** School Details, Buildings, Students, Course/Degree, College/Departments 


**School Details:** Name, Address, Dimensions, School Type, Year of establishment


**Buildings:** Name of building, Dimension of building, Number of floors, Number of rooms, Time in/ Time out 


**Students:** Name of student, ID number, Age, Sex, Number, Address


**Course/Degree:** Course Name, College Department, Type of degree (UG, masters, PhD), Passing Rate, Number of graduates


**College/Department:** Department Name, Number of faculty, Number of students, College code 


### NOTE: Class = Blueprint -> Object = The specific instance you make out of the class 


Ex: Class: DogName -> Object: Buddy 


## SESSION 2: Java vs C in syntax 


**1.** For Java, you need to wrap functions in a class 


**2.** You need to manually import scanner functions in Java (import.java.uti.Scanner)


**3.** You have to put f,l,d for float, double, long values. 


**4.** We have an actual String data type fo Java 


**5.** Same syntax for if-else and switch statements 


**6.** Same syntax for loops though java has that specific loop that looks like this: 


**7.** You need to define how accessible your functions are in Java (e.g: public, private, protected). 


 **8.** The keyword "static" shares a member to the whole class (it's not unique for every instance) 


**9.** For Arrays: You declare it like: <data type>[] Name;
