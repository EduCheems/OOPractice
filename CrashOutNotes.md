# CCPROG3: Object Oriented Programming

## SESSION 1: The Object-oriented Thinking Process

#### OOP means you apply variables as real-life objects with real-life relations, functions, and attributes via coding: 

**1.** #### Start with a concept:Object -> Attributes -> Functions/Behavior (Methods) 
**2.** ####Check the relationship with other objects: 
#### -Child/parent relationship with other objects/classes? -> **Encapsulation**
#### -Needs controlled access to its attributes/behavior? Wanna change something bout the object without affecting other attributes/behavior? -> **Encapsulation**
